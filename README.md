# Real-Time Fact-Checker for TV Debates

This project aims to develop a real-time fact-checker that analyzes TV debates by extracting statements from videos and classifying them as true or false. The tool uses a deep learning model for fact-checking and provides a web interface for users to interact with the model.

## Features

- **Real-Time Fact-Checking**: The model extracts statements from a TV debate video and classifies them as true or false.
- **Debate Video Upload**: Users can upload .mp4 debate videos to run the model.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: The results of the fact-checking are displayed in a user-friendly UI, highlighting false statements.
- **Project Overview Page**: The homepage provides project details and team information.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the web interface.
- **Deep Learning (Model)**: For analyzing and fact-checking statements.
- **Python (Backend)**: For running the model and processing video files.
- **FFmpeg**: For video processing and frame extraction.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For training and inference with the deep learning model.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
